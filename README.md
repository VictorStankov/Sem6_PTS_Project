# Scrum Poker Web App
A repository for storing a project for sixth semester's Software Design and Testing class.
The main goal is to simplify scrum estimation sessions by providing an intuitive way of casting votes as well as presenting statistics and charts.
Documentation will be updated based on the included features.

## How to run
The application was written on Python 3.11, but it should run perfectly well on older versions as well.

pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## Demo
If you're lucky enough and I've managed to find a machine to host the project on (other than my own PC), you can find a live version of it on this URL: https://scrumpoker-pts.ddns.net/
